## Ideas

- oh boy 3am
- security audit bot
- mod bot with scripting commands
- anti phishing/malware
- something with web dashboard (starlette-discord)
- something NASA API related
- bot that automatically points out the problems with your code
- GRASS TOUCHING BOT (duolingo but for touching grass)
- **inverse level bot, rewards you for inactivity**
- link discord chat to mc chat (shitty old project)
- CTF bot

## Inverse leveling bot, rewards you for inactivity

- listen to all events, store timestamp for any event for a user action
- timestamp per user, when something happens you reward them for the time elapsed and update the timer
- maybe handle user presence separately from "actions" like sending a message, reacting, etc
